## Implementation

### Create Programme

#### Overview

The **Create Programme** feature allows users to create a new workout programme, which can be either empty (with only a name)
or contain multiple days with specific exercises.

### Example Usage

1. **User Starts BuffBuddy**:

   - The user initiates the BuffBuddy application.
   - `BuffBuddy` begins by calling `Ui` to read a command.

2. **User Inputs Command**:

   - `Ui` reads the command from the user and returns it to `BuffBuddy` as `fullCommand`.

3. **Parsing the Command**:

   - `BuffBuddy` calls `Parser.parse(fullCommand)` to interpret the command.
   - `Parser` calls `CommandFactory.createCommand(commandString, argumentString)` to create an appropriate command based on `commandString`.

4. **Delegating to Specific Command Factory**:

   - `CommandFactory` checks if `commandString` is related to program commands. If it is, `CommandFactory` calls `ProgCommandFactory.parse(argumentString)`.

5. **Handling Create Subcommand**:

   - `ProgCommandFactory` checks if the subcommand is "create" and calls `prepareCreateCommand(arguments)` if it is.

6. **Parsing Program Details**:

   - In `prepareCreateCommand`, `ProgCommandFactory` iterates through each day specified in the `arguments`:

     - For each day:

       - `ProgCommandFactory.parseDay(dayString)` is called to parse details of the day.
       - A new `Day` object is created.
       - The parsed `Day` object is returned to `ProgCommandFactory`.

       - For each exercise within the day:
         - `ProgCommandFactory.parseExercise(exerciseString)` is called to parse exercise details.
         - A new `Exercise` object is created.
         - The parsed `Exercise` is inserted into the `Day` object.

     - The fully populated `Day` object, containing all exercises, and the programme name is returned.

7. **Creating `CreateProgrammeCommand`**:

   - After parsing the program structure, `ProgCommandFactory` creates a new `CreateProgrammeCommand` object with `progName` and parsed `days`.

8. **Returning to `CommandFactory`**:

   - `ProgCommandFactory` returns the `CreateProgrammeCommand` object to `CommandFactory`, which then passes it back to `Parser`.
   - `Parser` returns the command object to `BuffBuddy`.

9. **Executing `CreateProgrammeCommand`**:

   - `BuffBuddy` calls `CreateProgrammeCommand.execute()` to perform the action.
   - Inside `execute()`, `CreateProgrammeCommand` calls `ProgrammeList.insertProgramme(programmeName, programmeContents)` to add the new program to the list.

10. **Creating Program in `ProgrammeList`**:

    - `ProgrammeList` creates a new `Programme` object with the provided name and content.
    - The `Programme` object is added to the `ProgrammeList`.

11. **Generating Command Result**:

    - `CreateProgrammeCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` object, containing the result message of the operation.

12. **Returning the Result**:

    - `CreateProgrammeCommand` returns the `CommandResult` to `BuffBuddy`.

13. **Displaying the Result to the User**:
    - `BuffBuddy` calls `Ui.showMessage(result)` to display the result message.
    - `Ui` formats and displays the result to the user, completing the flow of operations for the "Create Programme" feature.

This process illustrates how BuffBuddy handles the creation of a workout program, from parsing user input to structuring program details and finally displaying the result back to the user.

#### Sequence Diagram

![Sequence Diagram for createProgramme feature](./images/createProgramme.png)

### Edit Programme

#### Overview

The **Edit Programme** feature allows for in-depth management of programme structures, supporting operations to add, remove, and update days and exercises within each programme.
Due to the nature of modelling a Workout Programme, a hierarchical data structure is used to represent workout data.

To perform an edit to any aspect of this data, the EditCommand will traverse the hierarchy until it reaches the necessary depth to perform its edit operation.

These operations include:

- Adding or removing Days to the Programme
- Adding or removing Exercises to Days in the Programme
- Updating the details of Exercises in Days in the Programme

#### Sequence Diagram

The overall design that enables this functionality is described generically by the following sequence diagram.

![Edit Command generic sequence](images/editCommand.png)

The 'Model' class in the above diagram is a generalization of the various data models that are being interacted with
to perform each specific edit command. For each edit command, the following sequence diagrams
further break down how this interaction works.

In each diagram, error handling has been simplified to keep the diagram brief.
Generally, if a conditional check fails (i.e. if the selected Programme does not exist), a ProgrammException will be thrown and interrupt the command exeuction. BuffBuddy will print the appropiate error message based on the Exception and then wait for the next command.

##### Add day

![Add Day](images/addDayCommand.png)

#### Delete Day

![Remove Day](images/deleteDayCommand.png)

##### Add Exercise

![Add Exercise](images/addExerciseCommand.png)

##### Delete Exercise

![Delete Exercise](images/deleteExerciseCommand.png)

##### Update Exercise

![Edit Exercise](images/editExerciseCommand.png)

##### Example Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario for 'delete exercise' and how the edit programme functions at each step.

Step 1. The user creates a programme with a given number of Days with their respective Exercises. ProgrammeList will contain a reference to this programme after its creation.

Step 2. The user executes `programme edit /p 1 /d 1 /x 1` to delete the first exercise in the first day of the first programme.

Step 3. After parsing this input, a `DeleteExerciseCommand` (inheriting from the generic `EditProgrammeCommand`) is created and executed.

Step 4. The command first retrieves the chosen Programme with `ProgrammeList#getProgramme()`.

Step 5. The command then retrieves the chosen Day with `Programme#getDay()`.

Step 6. With the Day object, it performs the `Day#deleteExercise()` with the given exercise ID

Step 7. The deleted Exercise object is then returned to the `DeleteExerciseCommand` to display as part of the returned `CommandResult`.

#### Activity Diagram

To summarize, the following activity diagram describes how the overall operation occurs.

![Edit Command Diagram](images/editCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Add Meal

#### Feature Implementation

The **Add Meal** feature manages the functionality related to adding meals to a daily record. It interacts with various components such as `History`, `DailyRecord`, and `MealList` to ensure meals are added correctly.

The **Add Meal** command navigates through the following hierarchy:

- **History** â†’ **DailyRecord** â†’ **MealList**
- If a `DailyRecord` does not exist for a given date, it is created before adding the meal.
- Similarly, a new `MealList` object is created and added to the `DailyRecord` if it doesn't already exist. The meal is then added to the `MealList` object.

These operations include:

- Adding meals to a `MealList` in the `DailyRecord` of a particular date in the `History`.

Given below is an example usage scenario for adding a meal and how the add meal command functions at each step.

#### Example Usage

**Step 1**: The user starts by adding a meal using the command:

meal add /n [mealName] /c [calories]

- The command is parsed and translated into an `AddMealCommand` object, which contains the meal object that is created as a wrapper for the name and calories.

**Step 2**: The command retrieves the `DailyRecord` for the specified date from the `History` using `getRecordByDate()`. If no record exists, a new one is created.

**Step 3**: The `AddMealCommand` adds the meal to the `MealList` of the `DailyRecord`. The `MealList` is then updated with the new list.

**Step 4**: The newly added `Meal` object is displayed as part of the `CommandResult`.

The overall design that enables this functionality is described generically by the following sequence diagram.

### Add Water

The **Add Water** feature manages the functionality related to adding water to a daily record. It interacts with various components such as `History`, `DailyRecord`, and `Water` to ensure water are added correctly.

The Add Water command navigates through the following hierarchy:

- **History** â†’ **DailyRecord** â†’ **Water**
- If a `DailyRecord` does not exist for a given date, it is created before adding the water.

These operations include:

- Adding a water log to `Water` in the `DailyRecord` of a particular date in `History`.
- Given below is an example usage scenario for adding a water log and how to add water command functions at each step.

#### Example Usage

**Step 1**: The user starts by adding a water log using the command:

water add /v WATER_VOLUME [/t Date]

- The command is parsed and translated into an `AddWaterCommand` object. Water contains an arrayList of floats, representing ml of water.

**Step 2**: The command retrieves the `DailyRecord` for the specified date from the `History` using `getRecordByDate()`. If no record exists, a new one is created.

**Step 3**: The `AddWaterCommand` adds the water log to the `Water` of the `DailyRecord`. The `Water` is then updated with the new water log.

**Step 4**: The newly added water log object is displayed as part of the `CommandResult`.

### WeeklySummary Feature

The Weekly Summary feature allows users to view a summary of their workouts for the current week. This functionality is achieved through a combination of several interconnected components, including `WeeklySummaryCommand`, `Parser`, `HistoryCommandFactory`, and `History`. Users can access this feature through the `history wk` command in the UI. The implementation follows a command pattern, combined with the factory pattern for command creation.

### Overview

The following components are crucial to the Weekly Summary feature:

1. **Parser Component**  
   The `Parser` interprets the initial command and directs the flow as follows:

   - **`Parser#parse(String)`**: Accepts the raw input string, splits it into the main command and arguments.
   - **`CommandFactory`**: Generates the appropriate command object based on the parsed input.
   - **`HistoryCommandFactory`**: Handles the creation of history-related commands, including `WeeklySummaryCommand`.

2. **WeeklySummaryCommand Component**  
   The `WeeklySummaryCommand` implements the `Command` interface and performs the following:

   - Extends the abstract `Command` class.
   - Uses the command word `"wk"`.
   - Executes by retrieving the weekly summary from the `History` object.
   - Returns a `CommandResult` that contains the formatted summary for display.

3. **History Component**  
   The `History` class manages workout data and provides:

   - **`getWeeklyWorkoutSummary()`**: Retrieves and formats the workout data for the current week.

### Example Usage

The following example illustrates the usage scenario and behavior of the Weekly Summary feature:

1. **Step 1**: The user enters the `"history wk"` command in the UI. The UI reads this command and passes it to the `Parser`.
2. **Step 2**: The `Parser` breaks down the command `"history wk"` into:
   - Main command: `"history"`
   - Subcommand: `"wk"`
3. **Step 3**: The `Parser` uses `CommandFactory`, which recognizes this as a history command and delegates to `HistoryCommandFactory`.
4. **Step 4**: `HistoryCommandFactory` identifies `"wk"` as the `WeeklySummaryCommand` trigger and creates a new `WeeklySummaryCommand` instance.
5. **Step 5**: The `WeeklySummaryCommand` is passed back through the chain to the UI, which then calls its `execute` method.
6. **Step 6**: During execution:
   - `WeeklySummaryCommand` calls `History`'s `getWeeklyWorkoutSummary()`.
   - The summary is formatted and wrapped in a `CommandResult`.
   - The UI displays the result to the user.

### Save/Load Feature

The save/load mechanism is handled by three main components: `Storage`, `FileManager`, and `DateSerializer`. `FileManager` manages file interactions, including reading from and writing to JSON data files, while `Storage` handles the conversion between JSON objects and `ProgrammeList`/`History` objects. The `DateSerializer` is used for converting `LocalDate` to/from JSON format.

### Example Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the save/load mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. A `Storage` object is initialized by `BuffyBuddy`, and it attempts to load data from
the file using `FileManager`. If no data file exists, `Storage` initializes an empty `ProgrammeList` and `History`.

**Step 2.** The user interacts with the application by adding programmes or logging workout activities and meals, modifying both the
`ProgrammeList` and `History`. After each command is carried out and when the user chooses to exit the application, `Storage#saveData()` is called.

**Step 3.** At this point, `Storage` converts the current `ProgrammeList` and `History` into JSON format using the `createJSON()` method and passes
the `JsonObject` to `FileManager#save()`.

**Step 4.** The `FileManager` saves the updated `JsonObject` to the data file, ensuring that the user's changes are preserved for the
next command or session. If necessary, `FileManager#createDirIfNotExist()` and `FileManager#createFileIfNotExist()` ensure that the correct directories
and files are in place before saving.

**Step 5.** The next time the user launches the application, `Storage#loadProgrammeList()` and `Storage#loadHistory()` are called, which
load the data from the file via `FileManager#load()`. The loaded data is then converted from JSON back into `ProgrammeList` and `History`
objects, restoring the user's previous session.

The following sequence diagram shows how a load operation for ProgrammeList goes through the Storage component:
