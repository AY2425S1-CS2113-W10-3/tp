## Features 


### 1. Create a New Program

Command: `prog create PROG_NAME /d /e /n EXERCISE_NAME /s SET /r REP /w WEIGHT`

Example: `prog create Starter /d ONE /e /n Bench_Press /s 3 /r 12 /w 30 /e /n Squat /s 3 /r 12 /w 50 /d TWO /e /n Bicep_Curl /s 3 /r 12 /w 10`

(To create a programme ‘Starter’ with Day One being Bench & Squat, Day Two being Bicep Curl.)

**Note**: Since this command can be quite long when adding multiple exercises across multiple days, you can alternatively create an empty program first and then edit it step by step.

### Alternative Method: Create an Empty Program and Edit It

1. **Create an Empty Program**:
    - Command: `prog create PROG_NAME`

   Example: `prog create Starter`

This creates a new program called "Starter" without adding any days or exercises.

2. **Edit the Program**:
- You can now use the `prog edit` command to add exercises or days to your program incrementally.

Example: `prog edit /p 1 /ad ONE /e /n Bench_Press /r 10 /s 30 /w 50`

This adds a new day "ONE" and inserts the exercise "Bench Press" with 10 reps, 30 sets, and 50kg.

### 2. View Program
Command: `prog view [INDEX]`

### 4. Edit Program

`d_day`: Day index (optional - defaults to active day).  
`command`: Abbreviated edits (/a for create exercise, /u for update exercise, /x for remove exercise, /ad for create day, /xd for remove day).  
`Args`: A set of flags to update for that specific exercise. (e.g., /w WEIGHT to update weight, /r REPS, and /s SETS in any order).

### 6. Log a Workout
